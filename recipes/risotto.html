        <li><h1>Step 1</h1><p>Melt the butter in a wide shallow pan. Cook the spring onions for 4-5 minutes or until soft. Add the rice and cook, stirring, for a couple of minutes. Add the wine, if using, and bubble until absorbed. Gradually stir in the stock a little at a time, again waiting until itâ€™s absorbed before adding more. Repeat until the rice is creamy, oozy and tender (you might not need to use all the stock, or you may need to add a splash more if the mixture is too thick).</p></li>
        <li><h1>Step 2</h1><p>Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a separate small pan over a medium-high heat and cook the tomatoes with lots of seasoning until they are just starting to burst.</p></li>
        <li><h1>Step 3</h1><p>Stir the mustard and cheese into the risotto, and season with pepper and a little salt if it needs it. Spoon into warm bowls and top with the tomatoes, a drizzle of balsamic and some basil.</p></li>
